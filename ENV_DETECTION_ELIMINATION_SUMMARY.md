## Environment Detection Elimination Complete

✅ **Successfully removed all environment detection mechanisms**

### Changes Made:
- ❌ Deleted `src/utils/environmentTest.js` - Complex environment testing utility 
- ❌ Deleted `src/utils/productionLogManager.js` - Referenced but already removed
- 🔧 Simplified `src/utils/config.js` - Removed all VITE_ env vars, hardcoded development defaults
- 🔧 Simplified `src/utils/devConsoleHelpers.js` - Removed productionLogManager dependency
- 🔧 Simplified `src/main.js` - Removed all import.meta.env.DEV checks, always load debug tools
- 🔧 Simplified `src/router/index.js` - Removed all environment checks, always enable logging
- �� Simplified `src/services/sse.js` - Use apiUrlResolver instead of VITE_API_BASE_URL
- 🔧 Simplified `src/services/sse-minimal.js` - Hardcoded '/events' endpoint
- 🔧 Simplified `vite.config.js` - Removed environment variables, always development mode
- 🔧 **162 files processed** by automated script to remove all environment checks

### Architecture Changes:
- 🎯 **Single Mode**: Development is now the only mode - no production/staging variants
- 🔧 **Simplified Configuration**: All settings hardcoded to development defaults
- 📊 **Always Debug**: All debug logging and tools always enabled
- 🚀 **No Environment Detection**: Eliminated complex detection logic throughout codebase
- ⚡ **Faster Startup**: No environment checks means faster initialization

### URL Resolution (Unchanged):
- localhost/127.0.0.1 → `/api` (Vite proxy)
- Everything else → `https://ca90-45-77-178-85.ngrok-free.app/api` (direct ngrok)

This completely eliminates the root cause of the '0 Channels, 0 Messages' issue by removing the complex environment detection that was causing API URL resolution problems.
