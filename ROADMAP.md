- Rollback plan ready

### üìä Honest Progress
```
Research Phase    ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 40%
Implementation    ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0%
Testing          ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0%
Documentation    ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 20%
```

### üö¶ Risk Factors
- **Technical Debt**: ~30% of codebase needs refactoring
